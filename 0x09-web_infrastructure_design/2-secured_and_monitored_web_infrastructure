Components:
1.	Load Balancer (HAproxy):
•	Purpose: Distribute incoming web traffic, ensuring high availability and load balancing.


2.	Web Servers (Nginx x3):
•	Purpose: Serve as the first point of contact for incoming HTTP requests. Handle static content, forward dynamic requests to the application servers.

3.	Application Servers (x3):
•	Purpose: Execute the web application code, process dynamic content requests, and generate responses.

4.	Database (MySQL Primary-Replica Cluster x2):
•	Purpose: Primary-Replica clusters provide data redundancy, improve read performance, and enhance availability.

5.	Firewalls (x3):
•	Purpose: Firewalls are added to enhance security by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic, preventing unauthorized access, and protecting against threats.

6.	SSL Certificate:
•	Purpose: To enable HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication between users and the website, enhancing security and user trust.

7.	Monitoring Clients (Data Collectors for Sumo Logic):
•	Purpose: Implement monitoring for performance, security, and availability. 
Sumo Logic collects and analyzes data to provide insights into system health and performance.


Specifics:
•	Firewalls: Added to control and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic, protecting the infrastructure from unauthorized access and malicious activity.
•	HTTPS: Traffic is served over HTTPS to encrypt data transmission between users and the website, 
preventing eavesdropping, data interception, and ensuring data integrity.
•	Monitoring: Used to:
•	Performance Monitoring: Observe server QPS (Queries Per Second), resource utilization, and application performance.
•	Security Monitoring: Detect and respond to security threats and vulnerabilities.
•	Availability Monitoring: Ensure that the infrastructure is up and serving requests.
•	Monitoring Data Collection: Monitoring tools like Sumo Logic collect data by installing agents or using 
APIs to gather performance metrics, logs, and other relevant data from servers, applications, and network devices.
•	Server QPS Monitoring: To monitor web server QPS, you would configure monitoring tools to collect and analyze 
metrics related to incoming requests and server load. Alerts can be set up to trigger notifications if QPS thresholds are exceeded.


Issues with This Infrastructure:
1.	Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:
•	Terminating SSL at the load balancer can be an issue because it means that the traffic between the load balancer and the web servers is unencrypted. 
It's recommended to use end-to-end encryption for maximum security.

2.	Single MySQL Server Capable of Accepting Writes:
•	This is a potential single point of failure for write operations. If the primary database server fails, it could lead to data loss and downtime. 
Consider using a database clustering solution for high availability.

3.	Servers with All the Same Components:
•	While uniformity can simplify management, it can be problematic because if there's a vulnerability or issue with a particular component (e.g., a software version),
it affects all servers. It's wise to have some diversity to minimize the impact of such issues.
